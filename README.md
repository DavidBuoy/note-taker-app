## Description
This is a program that allows you to add employees via the terminal command line once you are done it prints it to an html page. 

* I used Node JS and Javascript and custom classes to make this application work.

## User Story

The user now has a note-taking application, when I click on the link to the notes page, I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column. When I enter a new note title and the note’s text and hit the Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. If I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column. I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
